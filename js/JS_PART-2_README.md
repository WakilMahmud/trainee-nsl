- Program execution happens in Call Stack
- Memory allocation happens in Memory Heap
- JS Engine is inside JS Runtime
- We get asynchronous behavior due to Web API inside Runtime
- JS is synchronous, but it can do asynchronous task due to Runtime, especially for Web API.

Callback => Promise => Async/Await

- "async and await make promises easier to write"
- async makes a function return a Promise
- await makes a function wait for a Promise

<br>

- jQuery was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

- For more than 10 years, jQuery has been the most popular **JavaScript library** in the world.
- However, after JavaScript Version 5 (2009), most of the jQuery utilities can be solved with a few lines of standard JavaScript.
