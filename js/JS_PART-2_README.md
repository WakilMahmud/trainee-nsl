- Program execution happens in Call Stack
- Memory allocation happens in Memory Heap
- JS Engine is inside JS Runtime
- We get asynchronous behavior due to Web API inside Runtime
- JS is synchronous, but it can do asynchronous task due to Runtime, especially for Web API.

- Asynchronous programming makes your JavaScript programs run faster, and you can perform asynchronous programming with any of these:

  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - Async/Await

- "async and await make promises easier to write"
- async makes a function return a Promise
- await makes a function wait for a Promise

```js
// asynchronous example code

console.log("Task 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello from 3000ms");
}, 3000);

console.log("Task 2");

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let flag = true;

  if (flag) resolve("OK from Promise");
  else reject("Error from Promise");
});

promise.then((result) => console.log(result)).catch((err) => console.log(err));

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello from 0ms");
}, 0);

console.log("Task 3");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello from 100ms");
}, 100);
```

- A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.
- It can greatly simplify complex functions.
- It can provide easy syntax to complex code.

### Web Storage API

- The data is stored with no expiration date, and will not be deleted when the browser is closed.
- The difference is that the sessionStorage object stores data for one session. The data is deleted when the browser is closed.

### Web Workers and the DOM

- Normally web workers are not used for simple scripts, but for more **CPU intensive** tasks.

</a>

- Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:
  - The window object
  - The document object
  - The parent object

- jQuery was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

- For more than 10 years, jQuery has been the most popular **JavaScript library** in the world.
- However, after JavaScript Version 5 (2009), most of the jQuery utilities can be solved with a few lines of standard JavaScript.
