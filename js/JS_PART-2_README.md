- jQuery was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

- However, after JavaScript Version 5 (2009), most of the jQuery utilities can be solved with a few lines of standard JavaScript.
