- Program execution happens in Call Stack
- Memory allocation happens in Memory Heap
- JS Engine is inside JS Runtime
- We get asynchronous behavior due to Web API inside Runtime
- JS is synchronous, but it can do asynchronous task due to Runtime, especially for Web API.

Callback => Promise => Async/Await

- "async and await make promises easier to write"
- async makes a function return a Promise
- await makes a function wait for a Promise

<br>

- A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.
- It can greatly simplify complex functions.
- It can provide easy syntax to complex code.

### Web Storage API

- The data is stored with no expiration date, and will not be deleted when the browser is closed.
- The difference is that the sessionStorage object stores data for one session. The data is deleted when the browser is closed.

### Web Workers and the DOM

- Normally web workers are not used for simple scripts, but for more **CPU intensive** tasks.

</a>

- Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:
  - The window object
  - The document object
  - The parent object

<br>

- jQuery was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

- For more than 10 years, jQuery has been the most popular **JavaScript library** in the world.
- However, after JavaScript Version 5 (2009), most of the jQuery utilities can be solved with a few lines of standard JavaScript.
